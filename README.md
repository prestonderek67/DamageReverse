Damage Reverse World of Warcraft Addon

This addon has two purposes:
  - First is just a bare-bones damage meter. Updates DPS (Damage Per Second every two seconds), is resizable, and contains tooltips for spell breakdown on mouse hover.
  - Second, it has the ability, with a checkbox, to "reverse" the DPS of players.  This allows the player with the lowest DPS to be shown as the highest DPS.
